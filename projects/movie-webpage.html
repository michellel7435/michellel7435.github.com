          <h2>Tod The Teddy Bear</h2>
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <h6>Tuesday, October 31, 2023</h6>
          <p> For this project I had to work with a partner, Andre Pagan, to make a movie web page. This project was to use all the knowledge I had learnt with HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h4>Content</h4>
           <p> Me and my partner, Andre, decided to make something that was related to famous movies like Chucky. Our movie-webpage is based off a spirit who feels for one of the character, Megan. We were able to finish the project easily through communicating with each other and researching things we don't know how to make or understand. </p>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>Though it was an easy project, we still faced difficulties with divs. We struggled with adding divs because we both didn't know where it goes and when we did do the code, it comes out unexpected and not what we hoping for. When we asked for help, it was still yet to be confusing until we actually try googling on "how to add divs in CSS" and we were able to find our answer, and in the end we were successful. Another challenge was that me and my partner wanted to be extra and add background gradient which was extremely confusing. We were constantly googling and going through everything. Eventually we found a code and we tested it out which it worked.</p>
         <p>My takeaways with this projects was being able to communicate with someone and actually doing so well. Also I was able to learn how to use background gradient and divs. Before I was unable to use gradient and divs but this project had extended my knowledge. The next step I would like to take is trying to do more advance codes to be further ahead and making my website more creative. </p>
