           <h2>Neuroendoscopy</h2>
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <h6>Tuesday, October 31, 2023</h6>
            <p>For this project I had to come up with a topic as my year long project. For this project I chose Neuroendoscopy because I always had an obsession with the brain and wanting to become a brain surgeon.</p>
            <h4>Content</h4>
            <p>This project will mostly focus on the technologies that can help brain surgeons such as today's technologies and the future technology. I was able to think of an advance tool and create it using A-frame.</p>
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>I found this project really stressful and difficult because of all the things you have to learn before starting to create the website. I have struggled with my tool, A-frame, I struggled with it because I did not understand the code and shape positioning. What I had to keep doing was messing around with the positioning until I was able to find the pattern and when it came to searching for help, it did not help me as much and I was so confused. I was able to learn so much more things/information such as understanding bootstrap components, actually making a website, responsiveness, and so much more.</p>
            <p>My takeaways for this is finding a way to manage time and organizing my lines of code. At first I thought I had so much time so I let this project go for weeks and ended up so stressful towards the end because I hardly knew anything about my tool and it got difficult so that is when I started doing everything and getting everything together so I can have time to fix it. Also, organizing was a big part too because my code got so messy and it hurts to even look at it because it gets so confusing so I worked on making the code better.</p>
